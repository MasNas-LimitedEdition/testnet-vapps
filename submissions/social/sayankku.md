## Developer
- **Name**: Sayank  
- **GitHub**: @MasNas-LimitedEdition  
- **Discord**: sayankku_  
- **Experience**: Full-stack developer with experience in blockchain dApps, identity systems, and gamified web apps. Built small-scale DeFi prototypes and NFT-based utilities, with focus on usability and security.  

## Project

### Name & Category
- **Project**: Sayank Kick  
- **Category**: social + identity  

### Description
Sayank Kick is a decentralized social identity hub that allows users to build, verify, and showcase their online persona across platforms. It solves the problem of fragmented reputation by aggregating social proofs, wallet activity, and verified credentials into one portable identity. Users can “kickstart” their profile and earn recognition through interactions, on-chain badges, and trust scores.  

### SL Integration  
- Use Soundness Layer (SL) for **identity verification and trust proofs**.  
- Rely on **SL attestation services** to validate user-linked social accounts.  
- Employ **SL programmable reputation scores** to enhance community trust and prevent Sybil attacks.  

## Technical

### Architecture
1. **Frontend** provides a dashboard for identity creation and management.  
2. **Backend** handles API aggregation (socials, wallet events) and pushes proofs to blockchain.  
3. **Blockchain Layer (SL + Polygon/ETH)** stores attestations and proof of trust.  
4. **Storage** for metadata and user content via WALRUS/IPFS.  

### Stack
- **Frontend**: React + Tailwind  
- **Backend**: Node.js + Express  
- **Blockchain**: Soundness Layer (SL), Polygon/Ethereum  
- **Storage**: WALRUS + IPFS + PostgreSQL  

### Features
1. **Universal Identity Profile** – aggregate on/off-chain credentials.  
2. **Reputation & Trust Score** – powered by SL attestations.  
3. **Social Proof Hub** – link Discord, GitHub, wallets, and showcase verified presence.  

## Timeline

### PoC (2-4 weeks)
- [ ] Basic identity profile creation  
- [ ] SL integration for attestations  
- [ ] Simple UI dashboard  

### MVP (4-8 weeks)  
- [ ] Full social proof integration (GitHub, Discord, wallet)  
- [ ] Reputation scoring system  
- [ ] User testing + production deployment  

## Innovation
Unlike typical identity dApps, Sayank Kick combines **multi-platform reputation aggregation** with **programmable trust scoring** using SL. This creates a portable, verifiable identity that users can carry across DeFi, gaming, and social platforms. The mix of gamification (“kickstart” levels, badges) makes it engaging beyond static DID solutions.
